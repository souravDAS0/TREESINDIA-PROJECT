## Query Processing Flow

1. **User Input**: User sends a message
2. **Session Management**: Retrieve or create conversation session
3. **Query Analysis**: Parse user input using AI
4. **Intent Classification**: Determine query type and intent
5. **Data Fetching**: Retrieve relevant data from database
6. **Response Generation**: Generate AI response with data integration
7. **Suggestion Generation**: Create contextual suggestions
8. **Response Delivery**: Return structured response to user
