- DO NOT EVER USE Datasource directly in a notifier. in the Notifier call a usecase which calls a method in Repository. RepositoryImpl implements the Repository. the method in RepositoryImpl will call the Datasource. Datasource always returns model OR List<model> to the RepositoryImpl method and RepositoryImpl returns it as Entity OR List<Entity> . conversion from Model to Entity will happen in the method in RepositoryImpl using model.toEntity() method. the Api endpoints used in the Datasource will be defined in ApiEndpoints.dart file. ApiEndpoints.dart will have a list of ApiEndpoints. ApiEndpoints will have a path and requiresAuth. The path will be the path of the api endpoint. requiresAuth will be true if the endpoint requires authentication.
