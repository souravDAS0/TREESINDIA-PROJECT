# Service Types Analysis & Flow Documentation

## Overview

The TreesIndia platform supports two distinct service types with different booking flows and pricing models:

1. **Fixed Price Services** - Immediate booking with known pricing
2. **Inquiry-Based Services** - Quote-based booking with flexible pricing

## Service Types Breakdown

### 1. Fixed Price Services (`price_type: "fixed"`)

**Characteristics:**

- ✅ Has a specific `price` field with numeric value
- ✅ Immediate booking available
- ✅ Time slot reservation system
- ✅ Direct payment flow
- ✅ Confirmed scheduling upfront

**Booking Flow:**

1. Customer selects service and time slot
2. System checks worker availability for the slot
3. Creates booking with `temporary_hold` status (7-minute hold)
4. Customer completes payment via Razorpay
5. Booking status changes to `confirmed`
6. Admin can assign worker
7. Worker accepts and completes the service

**Admin Management:**

- Can set fixed prices
- Can manage service areas
- Can assign workers to confirmed bookings
- Can track booking status through completion

### 2. Inquiry-Based Services (`price_type: "inquiry"`)

**Characteristics:**

- ❌ No fixed price (price field is null)
- ✅ Quote-based pricing
- ✅ Flexible scheduling
- ✅ May require inquiry booking fee (configurable)
- ✅ Customer provides requirements for quote

**Booking Flow:**

1. Customer submits inquiry with requirements
2. System checks if inquiry fee is required (admin configurable)
3. If fee required: Customer pays inquiry fee
4. Booking created with `pending` or `confirmed` status
5. Admin reviews inquiry and provides quote
6. Customer accepts/rejects quote
7. If accepted: Scheduling and worker assignment
8. Service completion

**Admin Management:**

## Conclusion

The current system provides a solid foundation for both service types, but there are opportunities for improvement in:

1. **Admin Experience**: Better tools for managing different service types
2. **Customer Experience**: Streamlined booking flows
3. **Operational Efficiency**: Automated processes and better analytics
4. **Revenue Optimization**: Better quote management and pricing strategies

The enhanced admin interface will help administrators better understand and manage the two service types, leading to improved operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
